## Multi-resolution Blending - Solution Template

**NOTE:** All values and figures in this template are examples that you will need to replace with your own results

1. **Method Description.** : Describe the key implementation details for blending.
      **Step 0**:
      The process the pictures into right scale. 
      I firstly devide the picture by 255. Then I convert it into gray scale. 

      **Step1:** Build Laplacian pyramids LA and LB from images A and B
      I will calcualte the image after the Gaussian, and calculate the Laplacian by using the former layer minus later layer. 
      ```
      def get_Laplacian_Stack(iimg, N):
         w = iimg.shape[0]
         h = iimg.shape[1]

         gstack = np.zeros((w,h,N))
         for x in range(0,N):
            sigma = 2**x
            img = get_gaussian_filter(iimg,sigma)
            gstack[:,:,x] = img

         w,h,n = gstack.shape
         stack = np.zeros((w,h,n))
         for x in range(0,n-1):
            img = gstack[:,:,x]-gstack[:,:,x+1]
            stack[:,:,x] = img
            if x == n-2:
                  stack[:,:,x+1] = gstack[:,:,x+1]
         return stack
      ```

      **Step2:** Build a Gaussian pyramid GR from selected region R
      The Gaussian pyramid is get by having the filture after the Gaussian filter. The sigma will change as the exponential of 2. 
      ```
      def get_Gaussian_Stack(iimg, N, alpha):
         w, h= iimg.shape
         stack = np.zeros((w,h,N))
         for x in range(0,N):
            sigma = (2**(x*alpha))
            img = get_gaussian_filter(iimg,sigma)
            stack[:,:,x] = img
         return stack
      ```

      **Step3:** Form a combined pyramid LS from LA and LB using nodes of GR as weights and blended Collapse the LS pyramid to get the final blended
      â€¢ LS(i,j) = GR(I,j,)*LA(I,j) + (1-GR(I,j))*LB(I,j)
      And combine all the layers as a loop
      ```
      for x in range(0,N):
            left = mask_gstack[:,:,x]*left_lstack[:,:,x]
            right = (1 - mask_gstack[:,:,x])*right_lstack[:,:,x]
            blend += left + right
      ```


2. **Oraple.**  Include visualizations of the Oraple blending along any variations your tried (include both original images and the blended image)
      
      **The original picture is:**

      <div align="center">
         <img src="apple.jpeg" width="40%">
         <img src="orange.jpeg" width="40%">
      </div>

      **The results:**

      * The N is the number of total laplacian level I will have.

      * The alpha will affect the simga in the gaussian filter. alpha is sigma = 2**(x*alpha)

         N = 5 and alpha = 4
         <div align="center">
            <img src="./result1.png" width="51%">
         </div>
         N = 4 and alpha = 4
         <div align="center">
            <img src="./result2.png" width="51%">
         </div>
         N = 4 and alpha = 3
         <div align="center">
            <img src="./result3.png" width="51%">
         </div>

3. **Blends of your choice.**  Include visualizations of blends of your choice (include both original images and the blended image). Describe any modifications you made on top of what worked for the oraple.

      **The original picture is:**

      <div align="center">
         <img src="citygrey.png" width="40%">
         <img src="cometgrey.png" width="40%">
      </div>

      **The results:**


      <div align="center">
         <img src="./result_own.png" width="51%">
      </div>
